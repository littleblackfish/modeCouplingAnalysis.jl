# modeCouplingAnalysis

This is a julia framework to perform mode coupling analysis as described in [this](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.8598.pdf) paper. 

It was designed to provide an infrastructure for possible implementations of other analyses on protein dynamics. 

# protein type

This is a type that keeps a MD trajectory for a protein. Some pre-processing is necessary on the original trajectory.

## preprocessing of trajectory

1. Use your preffered MD trajectory tool (I use vmd)
  1. We will only use alpha carbons (name CA) so you should generate a trimmed down version of your trajectory. This will also result in a much smaller file that is easier to process.
  2. You should also align the trajectory. in VMD, this is done by RMSD trajectory tool
  3. Save the aligned trajectory of CA atoms in xyz format (traj.xyz). This is a plain text format that is easy to parse.
2. Use preprocess.awk script included here
  a. It parses xyz format trajectory file and generates a matrix formatted plaintext. 
  b. Use it as `preprocess.awk traj.xyz > R.dat`
