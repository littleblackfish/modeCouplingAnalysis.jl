# modeCouplingAnalysis

This is a julia framework to perform mode coupling analysis as described in this (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.8598.pdf) paper. 

It was designed to provide an infrastructure for possible implementations of other analyses on protein dynamics. 

# protein type

This is a type that keeps a MD trajectory for a protein.
Some pre-prossing is necessary on the original trajectory.
